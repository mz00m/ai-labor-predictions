      "title": "Human resource management in the age of generative artificial intelligence: Perspectives and research directions on ChatGPT",
      "abstract": "Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.",

      "title": "Navigating the confluence of artificial intelligence and education for sustainable development in the era of industry 4.0: Challenges, opportunities, and ethical dimensions",
      "abstract": "The emergence of Industry 4.0 marks a transformative era for businesses and industries, characterized by advanced technologies like automation, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), smart factories, and cyber-physical systems. This revolution promises significant advantages, including enhanced productivity, sustainable progress, and heightened resilience. However, the integration of Industry 4.0 is challenged by the need for a skilled workforce with expertise in areas such as information technology and data analytics. Higher education institutions (HEIs) play a vital role in equipping future professionals with these skills, necessitating curriculum updates and infrastructure enhancements. Simultaneously, the importance of education for sustainable development (ESD) has been underscored by global initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ESD instills a sense of responsibility for economic, ecological, and equitable well-being. As digital technologies blur the lines between industries, education faces the challenge of adapting to evolving demands. The integration of AI tools in education has emerged as a catalyst for reshaping learning experiences, fostering innovation, and preparing individuals for the digital age. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have garnered widespread attention and possess the potential to revolutionize various aspects of education. However, their integration raises ethical concerns, necessitates curriculum redesign, requires strategies for continuous learning, and demands alignment with industry standards. While the potential of AI integration in education is promising, there is a notable gap in the existing literature when it comes to exploring the ethical implications, the influence of AI on ESD, the impact on the structure of Blooms Taxonomy, collaboration between academia and industry, strategies for continuous learning, and the effective integration of AI tools for personalized learning. This paper aims to critically examine the integration of AI tools, with a specific emphasis on ChatGPT, in education within the context of ESD. It delves into the transformative potential, ethical considerations, imperatives for continuous learning, and the role of industry partnerships. By providing insights and strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about the evolving nature of education in a technologically driven world, equipping academic institutions to navigate the complexities and opportunities associated with AI integration in education more effectively.",

      "title": "Online Information and Offline Competition: The Emergence of Broadband Internet and Brick-and-Mortar Retailer Survival",
      "abstract": "This research examines how information access affects competition in offline markets. I study the relationship between broadband internet availability and brick-and-mortar retailer survival in the United States from 1999 through 2008, leveraging a period when competition from e-commerce channels was minimal and broadband’s primary effect on retailers stemmed from reduced search costs. Using an instrumental variables estimation strategy that links broadband availability to local slope terrain, I find that broadband availability decreased the likelihood of retailer exit. These effects were more pronounced for retailers that faced higher discovery-related search costs ex ante, specifically young and independent establishments and those in dense or urban markets. The findings suggest that online information access can reshape offline competitive dynamics by altering consumer search and discovery.

      "title": "From ChatGPT to ThreatGPT: Impact of Generative AI in Cybersecurity and Privacy",
      "abstract": "Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it’s critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive identification and understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in business. This study sought to develop a conceptual framework that gathers the negative aspects of GAI development in management and economics, with a focus on ChatGPT. Research Design & Methods: The study employed a narrative and critical literature review and developed a conceptual framework based on prior literature. We used a line of deductive reasoning in formulating our theoretical framework to make the study's overall structure rational and productive. Therefore, this article should be viewed as a conceptual article that highlights the controversies and threats of GAI in management and economics, with ChatGPT as a case study. Findings: Based on the conducted deep and extensive query of academic literature on the subject as well as professional press and Internet portals, we identified various controversies, threats, defects, and disadvantages of GAI, in particular ChatGPT. Next, we grouped the identified threats into clusters to summarize the seven main threats we see. In our opinion they are as follows: (i) no regulation of the AI market and urgent need for regulation, (ii) poor quality, lack of quality control, disinformation, deepfake content, algorithmic bias, (iii) automation-spurred job losses, (iv) personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, (v) social manipulation, weakening ethics and goodwill, (vi) widening socio-economic inequalities, and (vii) AI technostress. Implications & Recommendations: It is important to regulate the AI/GAI market. Advocating for the regulation of the AI market is crucial to ensure a level playing field, promote fair competition, protect intellectual property rights and privacy, and prevent potential geopolitical risks. The changing job market requires workers to continuously acquire new (digital) skills through education and retraining. As the training of AI systems becomes a prominent job category, it is important to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities. To mitigate the risks related to personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, GAI developers must prioritize ethical considerations and work to develop systems that prioritize user privacy and security. To avoid social manipulation and weaken ethics and goodwill, it is important to implement responsible AI practices and ethical guidelines: transparency in data usage, bias mitigation techniques, and monitoring of generated content for harmful or misleading information. Contribution & Value Added: This article may aid in bringing attention to the significance of resolving the ethical and legal considerations that arise from the use of GAI and ChatGPT by drawing attention to the controversies and hazards associated with these technologies.",

      "title": "A multilevel review of artificial intelligence in organizations: Implications for organizational behavior research and practice",
      "abstract": "Summary The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform‐based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well‐being.",

      "title": "The impact of ChatGPT on higher education",
      "abstract": "Introduction This study explores the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, with a particular focus on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). With the rapid advancement of AI, understanding its implications in the educational sector becomes paramount. Methods Utilizing databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, we systematically searched for literature on AI chatbots’ impact on HEIs. Our criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles, prominent media outlets, and English publications, excluding tangential AI chatbot mentions. After selection, data extraction focused on authors, study design, and primary findings. The analysis combined descriptive and thematic approaches, emphasizing patterns and applications of AI chatbots in HEIs. Results The literature review revealed diverse perspectives on ChatGPT’s potential in education. Notable benefits include research support, automated grading, and enhanced human-computer interaction. However, concerns such as online testing security, plagiarism, and broader societal and economic impacts like job displacement, the digital literacy gap, and AI-induced anxiety were identified. The study also underscored the transformative architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human interaction, and accessibility issues were identified. Discussion While AI’s global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study’s limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI’s overall effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines, it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible integration of such technologies within HEIs.",

The First Key Update (1) discussed developments in the capabilities of general-purpose AI models and systems and associated risks. This Key Update covers how various actors, including researchers, companies, and governments, are approaching risk management and technical mitigations for AI. The past year has seen important developments in AI risk management, including better techniques for training safer models and monitoring their outputs. While this represents tangible progress, significant gaps remain. It is often uncertain how effective current measures are at preventing harms, and effectiveness varies across time and applications. There are many opportunities to further strengthen existing safeguard techniques and to develop new ones. This Key Update provides a concise overview of critical developments in risk management practices and technical risk mitigation since the publication of the 2025 AI Safety Report in January. It highlights where progress is being made and where gaps remain. Above all, it aims to support policymakers, researchers, and the public in navigating a rapidly changing environment, helping them to make informed and timely decisions about the governance of general-purpose AI.

It addresses how AI is displacing human labor in certain functions like employment and demand scheduling. AI-assisted prediction and choice-making may result in higher efficiency and output. The article also emphasizes that outsourcing prediction duties might occasionally contribute to increased labor levels. The establishment of new duties for decision-making is made possible when computerized forecasting lowers uncertainty. Although there aren't many concrete instances of new occupations produced by AI developments, there may be room for creative opportunities for employment.The labor market is being significantly impacted by the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI). Human jobs are increasingly being replaced by automation driven by AI, which trend is predicted to continue. Although it is unclear how AI will affect employment, it is expected to result in job cuts in certain sectors and job increases in others. Humans ought to be ready for adaptation to these adjustments since AI will additionally going to modify the skills needed for jobs.",

This paper proposes a methodological framework to estimate the potential exposure of employment to AI using sector based data, addressing the limitations of occupation centered approaches in the Spanish context. By constructing an AI CNAE incidence matrix and applying it to provincial employment data for the period 2021 to 2023, we provide a territorial and gender disaggregated assessment of AI exposure across Spain. The results reveal stable structural patterns, with higher exposure in metropolitan and service oriented regions and a consistent gender gap, as female employment exhibits higher exposure in all territories. Rather than predicting job displacement, the framework offers a structural perspective on where AI is most likely to reshape work and skill demands, supporting evidence based policy and strategic planning.",

Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.",

      "abstract": "How many workers displaced by automation can realistically transition to safer jobs? We answer this using a validated knowledge graph of 9,978 Egyptian job postings, 19,766 skill activities, and 84,346 job-skill relationships (0.74% error rate). While 20.9% of jobs face high automation risk, we find that only 24.4% of at-risk workers have viable transition pathways--defined by $\\geq$3 shared skills and $\\geq$50% skill transfer. The remaining 75.6% face a structural mobility barrier requiring comprehensive reskilling, not incremental upskilling. Among 4,534 feasible transitions, process-oriented skills emerge as the highest-leverage intervention, appearing in 15.6% of pathways. These findings challenge optimistic narratives of seamless workforce adaptation and demonstrate that emerging economies require active pathway creation, not passive skill matching.",

While these advancements promise efficiency, productivity, and innovation, they also pose ethical and socioeconomic challenges, particularly in terms of labor displacement, wage disparity, and the widening inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. This paper critically examines the implications of technological progress for human labor through an ethical and socioeconomic lens. Drawing upon interdisciplinary research in economics, sociology, and philosophy, it explores how automation reshapes employment structures, challenges traditional notions of human value, and demands new models of distributive justice.

      "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) agents are deployed across economic domains, understanding their strategic behavior and market-level impact becomes critical. This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.",

Employing a novel Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) algorithm trained via contrastive learning and LLM-driven data augmentation, we map vacancy requirements to the ESCO framework. By benchmarking occupation-skill relationships against 2018 O*NET-ESCO mappings, we document a robust causal relationship between AI adoption and the expansion of skill portfolios. Our analysis identifies two distinct mechanisms. First, AI reduces information asymmetry in the labor market, enabling firms to specify current occupation-specific requirements with greater precision. Second, AI empowers firms to anticipate evolving labor market dynamics. We find that AI adoption significantly increases the demand for \"forward-looking\" skills--those absent from 2018 standards but subsequently codified in 2022 updates. This suggests that AI allows firms to lead, rather than follow, the formal evolution of occupational standards. Our findings highlight AI's dual role as both a stabilizer of current recruitment information and a catalyst for proactive adaptation to future skill shifts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.",

This revolution promises significant advantages, including enhanced productivity, sustainable progress, and heightened resilience. However, the integration of Industry 4.0 is challenged by the need for a skilled workforce with expertise in areas such as information technology and data analytics. Higher education institutions (HEIs) play a vital role in equipping future professionals with these skills, necessitating curriculum updates and infrastructure enhancements. Simultaneously, the importance of education for sustainable development (ESD) has been underscored by global initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ESD instills a sense of responsibility for economic, ecological, and equitable well-being. As digital technologies blur the lines between industries, education faces the challenge of adapting to evolving demands. The integration of AI tools in education has emerged as a catalyst for reshaping learning experiences, fostering innovation, and preparing individuals for the digital age.

        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive identification and understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in business. This study sought to develop a conceptual framework that gathers the negative aspects of GAI development in management and economics, with a focus on ChatGPT. Research Design & Methods: The study employed a narrative and critical literature review and developed a conceptual framework based on prior literature. We used a line of deductive reasoning in formulating our theoretical framework to make the study's overall structure rational and productive. Therefore, this article should be viewed as a conceptual article that highlights the controversies and threats of GAI in management and economics, with ChatGPT as a case study. Findings: Based on the conducted deep and extensive query of academic literature on the subject as well as professional press and Internet portals, we identified various controversies, threats, defects, and disadvantages of GAI, in particular ChatGPT. Next, we grouped the identified threats into clusters to summarize the seven main threats we see. In our opinion they are as follows: (i) no regulation of the AI market and urgent need for regulation, (ii) poor quality, lack of quality control, disinformation, deepfake content, algorithmic bias, (iii) automation-spurred job losses, (iv) personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, (v) social manipulation, weakening ethics and goodwill, (vi) widening socio-economic inequalities, and (vii) AI technostress. Implications & Recommendations: It is important to regulate the AI/GAI market. Advocating for the regulation of the AI market is crucial to ensure a level playing field, promote fair competition, protect intellectual property rights and privacy, and prevent potential geopolitical risks. The changing job market requires workers to continuously acquire new (digital) skills through education and retraining. As the training of AI systems becomes a prominent job category, it is important to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities. To mitigate the risks related to personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, GAI developers must prioritize ethical considerations and work to develop systems that prioritize user privacy and security. To avoid social manipulation and weaken ethics and goodwill, it is important to implement responsible AI practices and ethical guidelines: transparency in data usage, bias mitigation techniques, and monitoring of generated content for harmful or misleading information. Contribution & Value Added: This article may aid in bringing attention to the significance of resolving the ethical and legal considerations that arise from the use of GAI and ChatGPT by drawing attention to the controversies and hazards associated with these technologies.",

        "abstract": "Summary The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform‐based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well‐being.",

It addresses how AI is displacing human labor in certain functions like employment and demand scheduling. AI-assisted prediction and choice-making may result in higher efficiency and output. The article also emphasizes that outsourcing prediction duties might occasionally contribute to increased labor levels. The establishment of new duties for decision-making is made possible when computerized forecasting lowers uncertainty. Although there aren't many concrete instances of new occupations produced by AI developments, there may be room for creative opportunities for employment.The labor market is being significantly impacted by the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI). Human jobs are increasingly being replaced by automation driven by AI, which trend is predicted to continue. Although it is unclear how AI will affect employment, it is expected to result in job cuts in certain sectors and job increases in others. Humans ought to be ready for adaptation to these adjustments since AI will additionally going to modify the skills needed for jobs.",

This paper proposes a methodological framework to estimate the potential exposure of employment to AI using sector based data, addressing the limitations of occupation centered approaches in the Spanish context. By constructing an AI CNAE incidence matrix and applying it to provincial employment data for the period 2021 to 2023, we provide a territorial and gender disaggregated assessment of AI exposure across Spain. The results reveal stable structural patterns, with higher exposure in metropolitan and service oriented regions and a consistent gender gap, as female employment exhibits higher exposure in all territories. Rather than predicting job displacement, the framework offers a structural perspective on where AI is most likely to reshape work and skill demands, supporting evidence based policy and strategic planning.",

        "abstract": "Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.",

We answer this using a validated knowledge graph of 9,978 Egyptian job postings, 19,766 skill activities, and 84,346 job-skill relationships (0.74% error rate). While 20.9% of jobs face high automation risk, we find that only 24.4% of at-risk workers have viable transition pathways--defined by $\\geq$3 shared skills and $\\geq$50% skill transfer. The remaining 75.6% face a structural mobility barrier requiring comprehensive reskilling, not incremental upskilling. Among 4,534 feasible transitions, process-oriented skills emerge as the highest-leverage intervention, appearing in 15.6% of pathways. These findings challenge optimistic narratives of seamless workforce adaptation and demonstrate that emerging economies require active pathway creation, not passive skill matching.",

        "abstract": "The global economy is undergoing a profound transformation driven by automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital technologies that are redefining the structure and meaning of work. While these advancements promise efficiency, productivity, and innovation, they also pose ethical and socioeconomic challenges, particularly in terms of labor displacement, wage disparity, and the widening inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. This paper critically examines the implications of technological progress for human labor through an ethical and socioeconomic lens. Drawing upon interdisciplinary research in economics, sociology, and philosophy, it explores how automation reshapes employment structures, challenges traditional notions of human value, and demands new models of distributive justice. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for inclusive policies, ethical governance, and education reform to ensure that technological evolution",

        "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.",

        "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) agents are deployed across economic domains, understanding their strategic behavior and market-level impact becomes critical. This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on skill requirements using 14 million online job vacancies from Chinese listed firms (2018-2022). Employing a novel Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) algorithm trained via contrastive learning and LLM-driven data augmentation, we map vacancy requirements to the ESCO framework. By benchmarking occupation-skill relationships against 2018 O*NET-ESCO mappings, we document a robust causal relationship between AI adoption and the expansion of skill portfolios. Our analysis identifies two distinct mechanisms. First, AI reduces information asymmetry in the labor market, enabling firms to specify current occupation-specific requirements with greater precision. Second, AI empowers firms to anticipate evolving labor market dynamics. We find that AI adoption significantly increases the demand for \"forward-looking\" skills--those absent from 2018 standards but subsequently codified in 2022 updates. This suggests that AI allows firms to lead, rather than follow, the formal evolution of occupational standards. Our findings highlight AI's dual role as both a stabilizer of current recruitment information and a catalyst for proactive adaptation to future skill shifts.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the edge is the utilization of AI in real-world devices. Edge AI refers to the practice of doing AI computations near the users at the network's edge, instead of centralised location like a cloud service provider's data centre. With the latest innovations in AI efficiency, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the rise of edge computing, the potential of edge AI has now been unlocked. This study provides a thorough analysis of AI approaches and capabilities as they pertain to edge computing, or Edge AI. Further, a detailed survey of edge computing and its paradigms including transition to Edge AI is presented to explore the background of each variant proposed for implementing Edge Computing. Furthermore, we discussed the Edge AI approach to deploying AI algorithms and models on edge devices, which are typically resource-constrained devices located at the edge of the network. We also presented the technology used in various modern IoT applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart homes, industrial automation, healthcare, and surveillance. Moreover, the discussion of leveraging machine learning algorithms optimized for resource-constrained environments is presented. Finally, important open challenges and potential research directions in the field of edge computing and edge AI have been identified and investigated. We hope that this article will serve as a common goal for a future blueprint that will unite important stakeholders and facilitates to accelerate development in the field of Edge AI.",

        "abstract": "This research examines how information access affects competition in offline markets. I study the relationship between broadband internet availability and brick-and-mortar retailer survival in the United States from 1999 through 2008, leveraging a period when competition from e-commerce channels was minimal and broadband’s primary effect on retailers stemmed from reduced search costs. Using an instrumental variables estimation strategy that links broadband availability to local slope terrain, I find that broadband availability decreased the likelihood of retailer exit. These effects were more pronounced for retailers that faced higher discovery-related search costs ex ante, specifically young and independent establishments and those in dense or urban markets. The findings suggest that online information access can reshape offline competitive dynamics by altering consumer search and discovery.

        "abstract": "This is the Second Key Update to the 2025 International AI Safety Report. The First Key Update (1) discussed developments in the capabilities of general-purpose AI models and systems and associated risks. This Key Update covers how various actors, including researchers, companies, and governments, are approaching risk management and technical mitigations for AI. The past year has seen important developments in AI risk management, including better techniques for training safer models and monitoring their outputs. While this represents tangible progress, significant gaps remain. It is often uncertain how effective current measures are at preventing harms, and effectiveness varies across time and applications. There are many opportunities to further strengthen existing safeguard techniques and to develop new ones. This Key Update provides a concise overview of critical developments in risk management practices and technical risk mitigation since the publication of the 2025 AI Safety Report in January. It highlights where progress is being made and where gaps remain. Above all, it aims to support policymakers, researchers, and the public in navigating a rapidly changing environment, helping them to make informed and timely decisions about the governance of general-purpose AI.
