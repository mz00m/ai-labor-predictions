      "title": "Human resource management in the age of generative artificial intelligence: Perspectives and research directions on ChatGPT",
      "abstract": "Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.",

      "title": "Navigating the confluence of artificial intelligence and education for sustainable development in the era of industry 4.0: Challenges, opportunities, and ethical dimensions",
      "abstract": "The emergence of Industry 4.0 marks a transformative era for businesses and industries, characterized by advanced technologies like automation, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), smart factories, and cyber-physical systems. This revolution promises significant advantages, including enhanced productivity, sustainable progress, and heightened resilience. However, the integration of Industry 4.0 is challenged by the need for a skilled workforce with expertise in areas such as information technology and data analytics. Higher education institutions (HEIs) play a vital role in equipping future professionals with these skills, necessitating curriculum updates and infrastructure enhancements. Simultaneously, the importance of education for sustainable development (ESD) has been underscored by global initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ESD instills a sense of responsibility for economic, ecological, and equitable well-being. As digital technologies blur the lines between industries, education faces the challenge of adapting to evolving demands. The integration of AI tools in education has emerged as a catalyst for reshaping learning experiences, fostering innovation, and preparing individuals for the digital age. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have garnered widespread attention and possess the potential to revolutionize various aspects of education. However, their integration raises ethical concerns, necessitates curriculum redesign, requires strategies for continuous learning, and demands alignment with industry standards. While the potential of AI integration in education is promising, there is a notable gap in the existing literature when it comes to exploring the ethical implications, the influence of AI on ESD, the impact on the structure of Blooms Taxonomy, collaboration between academia and industry, strategies for continuous learning, and the effective integration of AI tools for personalized learning. This paper aims to critically examine the integration of AI tools, with a specific emphasis on ChatGPT, in education within the context of ESD. It delves into the transformative potential, ethical considerations, imperatives for continuous learning, and the role of industry partnerships. By providing insights and strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about the evolving nature of education in a technologically driven world, equipping academic institutions to navigate the complexities and opportunities associated with AI integration in education more effectively.",

      "abstract": "This research examines how information access affects competition in offline markets. I study the relationship between broadband internet availability and brick-and-mortar retailer survival in the United States from 1999 through 2008, leveraging a period when competition from e-commerce channels was minimal and broadband’s primary effect on retailers stemmed from reduced search costs. Using an instrumental variables estimation strategy that links broadband availability to local slope terrain, I find that broadband availability decreased the likelihood of retailer exit. These effects were more pronounced for retailers that faced higher discovery-related search costs ex ante, specifically young and independent establishments and those in dense or urban markets. The findings suggest that online information access can reshape offline competitive dynamics by altering consumer search and discovery.

      "title": "From ChatGPT to ThreatGPT: Impact of Generative AI in Cybersecurity and Privacy",
      "abstract": "Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it’s critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive identification and understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in business. This study sought to develop a conceptual framework that gathers the negative aspects of GAI development in management and economics, with a focus on ChatGPT. Research Design & Methods: The study employed a narrative and critical literature review and developed a conceptual framework based on prior literature. We used a line of deductive reasoning in formulating our theoretical framework to make the study's overall structure rational and productive. Therefore, this article should be viewed as a conceptual article that highlights the controversies and threats of GAI in management and economics, with ChatGPT as a case study. Findings: Based on the conducted deep and extensive query of academic literature on the subject as well as professional press and Internet portals, we identified various controversies, threats, defects, and disadvantages of GAI, in particular ChatGPT. Next, we grouped the identified threats into clusters to summarize the seven main threats we see. In our opinion they are as follows: (i) no regulation of the AI market and urgent need for regulation, (ii) poor quality, lack of quality control, disinformation, deepfake content, algorithmic bias, (iii) automation-spurred job losses, (iv) personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, (v) social manipulation, weakening ethics and goodwill, (vi) widening socio-economic inequalities, and (vii) AI technostress. Implications & Recommendations: It is important to regulate the AI/GAI market. Advocating for the regulation of the AI market is crucial to ensure a level playing field, promote fair competition, protect intellectual property rights and privacy, and prevent potential geopolitical risks. The changing job market requires workers to continuously acquire new (digital) skills through education and retraining. As the training of AI systems becomes a prominent job category, it is important to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities. To mitigate the risks related to personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, GAI developers must prioritize ethical considerations and work to develop systems that prioritize user privacy and security. To avoid social manipulation and weaken ethics and goodwill, it is important to implement responsible AI practices and ethical guidelines: transparency in data usage, bias mitigation techniques, and monitoring of generated content for harmful or misleading information. Contribution & Value Added: This article may aid in bringing attention to the significance of resolving the ethical and legal considerations that arise from the use of GAI and ChatGPT by drawing attention to the controversies and hazards associated with these technologies.",

      "title": "A multilevel review of artificial intelligence in organizations: Implications for organizational behavior research and practice",
      "abstract": "Summary The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform‐based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research.

      "title": "The impact of ChatGPT on higher education",
      "abstract": "Introduction This study explores the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, with a particular focus on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). With the rapid advancement of AI, understanding its implications in the educational sector becomes paramount. Methods Utilizing databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, we systematically searched for literature on AI chatbots’ impact on HEIs. Our criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles, prominent media outlets, and English publications, excluding tangential AI chatbot mentions. After selection, data extraction focused on authors, study design, and primary findings. The analysis combined descriptive and thematic approaches, emphasizing patterns and applications of AI chatbots in HEIs. Results The literature review revealed diverse perspectives on ChatGPT’s potential in education. Notable benefits include research support, automated grading, and enhanced human-computer interaction. However, concerns such as online testing security, plagiarism, and broader societal and economic impacts like job displacement, the digital literacy gap, and AI-induced anxiety were identified. The study also underscored the transformative architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human interaction, and accessibility issues were identified. Discussion While AI’s global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study’s limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI’s overall effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines, it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible integration of such technologies within HEIs.",

      "abstract": "This is the Second Key Update to the 2025 International AI Safety Report. The First Key Update (1) discussed developments in the capabilities of general-purpose AI models and systems and associated risks. This Key Update covers how various actors, including researchers, companies, and governments, are approaching risk management and technical mitigations for AI. The past year has seen important developments in AI risk management, including better techniques for training safer models and monitoring their outputs. While this represents tangible progress, significant gaps remain. It is often uncertain how effective current measures are at preventing harms, and effectiveness varies across time and applications. There are many opportunities to further strengthen existing safeguard techniques and to develop new ones. This Key Update provides a concise overview of critical developments in risk management practices and technical risk mitigation since the publication of the 2025 AI Safety Report in January. It highlights where progress is being made and where gaps remain. Above all, it aims to support policymakers, researchers, and the public in navigating a rapidly changing environment, helping them to make informed and timely decisions about the governance of general-purpose AI.

This paper proposes a methodological framework to estimate the potential exposure of employment to AI using sector based data, addressing the limitations of occupation centered approaches in the Spanish context. By constructing an AI CNAE incidence matrix and applying it to provincial employment data for the period 2021 to 2023, we provide a territorial and gender disaggregated assessment of AI exposure across Spain. The results reveal stable structural patterns, with higher exposure in metropolitan and service oriented regions and a consistent gender gap, as female employment exhibits higher exposure in all territories. Rather than predicting job displacement, the framework offers a structural perspective on where AI is most likely to reshape work and skill demands, supporting evidence based policy and strategic planning.",

      "abstract": "Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.",

We answer this using a validated knowledge graph of 9,978 Egyptian job postings, 19,766 skill activities, and 84,346 job-skill relationships (0.74% error rate). While 20.9% of jobs face high automation risk, we find that only 24.4% of at-risk workers have viable transition pathways--defined by $\\geq$3 shared skills and $\\geq$50% skill transfer. The remaining 75.6% face a structural mobility barrier requiring comprehensive reskilling, not incremental upskilling. Among 4,534 feasible transitions, process-oriented skills emerge as the highest-leverage intervention, appearing in 15.6% of pathways. These findings challenge optimistic narratives of seamless workforce adaptation and demonstrate that emerging economies require active pathway creation, not passive skill matching.",

Studies have increasingly focused on understanding the mechanisms by which certain jobs may be at higher risk of displacement by AI. These studies categorize tasks and skills to assess which jobs are more likely to be complemented or substituted by AI. We investigate how people’s beliefs and expectations about AI compare with theoretical predictions regarding the future impact of automation on their respective jobs, focusing on attitudes toward AI technologies. Our analysis uses data from surveys collected before and after the rise of generative AI (in 2018 and 2024). Specifically, we examine whether people are generally hopeful or fearful of these technologies, and whether they believe AI will exacerbate unemployment or create new job opportunities. We assess how workers’ beliefs about AI are associated with two categories of factors: personal characteristics and job characteristics. Finally, we examine how these influencing factors changed after the introduction of generative AI",

      "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) agents are deployed across economic domains, understanding their strategic behavior and market-level impact becomes critical. This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on skill requirements using 14 million online job vacancies from Chinese listed firms (2018-2022). Employing a novel Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) algorithm trained via contrastive learning and LLM-driven data augmentation, we map vacancy requirements to the ESCO framework. By benchmarking occupation-skill relationships against 2018 O*NET-ESCO mappings, we document a robust causal relationship between AI adoption and the expansion of skill portfolios. Our analysis identifies two distinct mechanisms. First, AI reduces information asymmetry in the labor market, enabling firms to specify current occupation-specific requirements with greater precision. Second, AI empowers firms to anticipate evolving labor market dynamics. We find that AI adoption significantly increases the demand for \"forward-looking\" skills--those absent from 2018 standards but subsequently codified in 2022 updates. This suggests that AI allows firms to lead, rather than follow, the formal evolution of occupational standards. Our findings highlight AI's dual role as both a stabilizer of current recruitment information and a catalyst for proactive adaptation to future skill shifts.",

      "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into China's economy presents a classic governance challenge: how to harness its growth potential while managing its disruptive effects on traditional capital and labor markets. This study addresses this policy dilemma by modeling the dynamic interactions between AI capital, physical capital, and labor within a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey framework. Using annual Chinese data (2016-2023), we quantify the interaction strengths, identify stable equilibria, and perform a global sensitivity analysis. Our results reveal a consistent pattern where AI capital acts as the 'prey', stimulating both physical capital accumulation and labor compensation (wage bill), while facing only weak constraining feedback. The equilibrium points are stable nodes, indicating a policy-mediated convergence path rather than volatile cycles. Critically, the sensitivity analysis shows that the labor market equilibrium is overwhelmingly driven by AI-related parameters, whereas the physical capital equilibrium is also influenced by its own saturation dynamics. These findings provide a systemic, quantitative basis for policymakers: (1) to calibrate AI promotion policies by recognizing the asymmetric leverage points in capital vs. labor markets; (2) to anticipate and mitigate structural rigidities that may arise from current regulatory settings; and (3) to prioritize interventions that foster complementary growth between AI and traditional economic structures while ensuring broad-base distribution of technological gains.",

      "abstract": "This full paper describes an LLM-assisted instruction integrated with a virtual cybersecurity lab platform. The digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially among older workers. With rising emphasis on robotics, automation, AI, and security, re-skilling and up-skilling are essential. Generative AI can help build this workforce by acting as an instructional assistant to support skill acquisition during experiential learning. We present a generative AI instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential learning platform. The assistant employs a zero-shot OCR-LLM pipeline within the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform (2015). Text is extracted from slide images using Tesseract OCR, then simplified instructions are generated via a general-purpose LLM, enabling real-time instructional support with minimal infrastructure. The system was evaluated in a live university course where student feedback (n=42) averaged 7.83/10, indicating strong perceived usefulness. A comparative study with multimodal LLMs that directly interpret slide images showed higher performance on visually dense slides, but the OCR-LLM pipeline provided comparable pedagogical value on text-centric slides with much lower computational overhead and cost. This work demonstrates that a lightweight, easily integrable pipeline can effectively extend legacy platforms with modern generative AI, offering scalable enhancements for student comprehension in technical education.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration. Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend: Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for digital literacy and artificial intelligence (AI) fluency in the workforce has highlighted the need for scalable, efficient programming instruction. This study evaluates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI, specifically OpenAIs ChatGPT, into a self-paced Python programming module embedded within a sixteen-week professional training course on applied generative AI. A total of 86 adult learners with varying levels of programming experience completed asynchronous Python instruction in Weeks three and four, using ChatGPT to generate, interpret, and debug code. Python proficiency and general coding knowledge was assessed across 30 different assessments during the first 13 weeks of the course through timed, code-based evaluations. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed that learners without prior programming experience scored significantly lower than their peers on early assessments. However, following the completion of the accelerated Python instruction module, these group differences were no longer statistically significant,, indicating that the intervention effectively closed initial performance gaps and supported proficiency gains across all learner groups. These findings suggest that generative AI can support accelerated learning outcomes and reduce entry barriers for learners with no prior coding background. While ChatGPT effectively facilitated foundational skill acquisition, the study also highlights the importance of balancing AI assistance with opportunities for independent problem-solving. The results support the potential of AI-augmented instruction as a scalable model for reskilling in the digital economy.",

      "abstract": "The growing emphasis on 21st-century competencies in postsecondary education, intensified by the transformative impact of generative AI, underscores the need to evaluate how these competencies are embedded in curricula and how effectively academic programs align with evolving workforce and societal demands. Curricular Analytics, particularly recent generative AI-powered approaches, offer a promising data-driven pathway. However, analyzing 21st-century competencies requires pedagogical reasoning beyond surface-level information retrieval, and the capabilities of large language models in this context remain underexplored. In this study, we extend prior curricular analytics research by examining a broader range of curriculum documents, competency frameworks, and models. Using 7,600 manually annotated curriculum-competency alignment scores, we assess the informativeness of different curriculum sources, benchmark general-purpose LLMs for curriculum-to-competency mapping, and analyze error patterns. We further introduce a reasoning-based prompting strategy, Curricular CoT, to strengthen LLMs' pedagogical reasoning. Our results show that detailed instructional activity descriptions are the most informative type of curriculum document for competency analytics. Open-weight LLMs achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary models on coarse-grained tasks, demonstrating their scalability and cost-effectiveness for institutional use. However, no model reaches human-level precision in fine-grained pedagogical reasoning. Our proposed Curricular CoT yields modest improvements by reducing bias in instructional keyword inference and improving the detection of nuanced pedagogical evidence in long text. Together, these findings highlight the untapped potential of institutional curriculum documents and provide an empirical foundation for advancing AI-driven curricular analytics.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a qualitative shift in technological change by extending cognitive labor itself rather than merely automating routine tasks. Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale.",

      "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is diffusing rapidly, yet its adoption is strikingly unequal. Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.",

While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.",

        "abstract": "Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it’s critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive identification and understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in business. This study sought to develop a conceptual framework that gathers the negative aspects of GAI development in management and economics, with a focus on ChatGPT. Research Design & Methods: The study employed a narrative and critical literature review and developed a conceptual framework based on prior literature. We used a line of deductive reasoning in formulating our theoretical framework to make the study's overall structure rational and productive. Therefore, this article should be viewed as a conceptual article that highlights the controversies and threats of GAI in management and economics, with ChatGPT as a case study. Findings: Based on the conducted deep and extensive query of academic literature on the subject as well as professional press and Internet portals, we identified various controversies, threats, defects, and disadvantages of GAI, in particular ChatGPT. Next, we grouped the identified threats into clusters to summarize the seven main threats we see. In our opinion they are as follows: (i) no regulation of the AI market and urgent need for regulation, (ii) poor quality, lack of quality control, disinformation, deepfake content, algorithmic bias, (iii) automation-spurred job losses, (iv) personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, (v) social manipulation, weakening ethics and goodwill, (vi) widening socio-economic inequalities, and (vii) AI technostress. Implications & Recommendations: It is important to regulate the AI/GAI market. Advocating for the regulation of the AI market is crucial to ensure a level playing field, promote fair competition, protect intellectual property rights and privacy, and prevent potential geopolitical risks. The changing job market requires workers to continuously acquire new (digital) skills through education and retraining. As the training of AI systems becomes a prominent job category, it is important to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities. To mitigate the risks related to personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, GAI developers must prioritize ethical considerations and work to develop systems that prioritize user privacy and security. To avoid social manipulation and weaken ethics and goodwill, it is important to implement responsible AI practices and ethical guidelines: transparency in data usage, bias mitigation techniques, and monitoring of generated content for harmful or misleading information. Contribution & Value Added: This article may aid in bringing attention to the significance of resolving the ethical and legal considerations that arise from the use of GAI and ChatGPT by drawing attention to the controversies and hazards associated with these technologies.",

        "abstract": "Summary The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform‐based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well‐being.",

The study also underscored the transformative architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human interaction, and accessibility issues were identified. Discussion While AI’s global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study’s limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI’s overall effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines, it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible integration of such technologies within HEIs.",

This paper proposes a methodological framework to estimate the potential exposure of employment to AI using sector based data, addressing the limitations of occupation centered approaches in the Spanish context. By constructing an AI CNAE incidence matrix and applying it to provincial employment data for the period 2021 to 2023, we provide a territorial and gender disaggregated assessment of AI exposure across Spain. The results reveal stable structural patterns, with higher exposure in metropolitan and service oriented regions and a consistent gender gap, as female employment exhibits higher exposure in all territories. Rather than predicting job displacement, the framework offers a structural perspective on where AI is most likely to reshape work and skill demands, supporting evidence based policy and strategic planning.",

These results highlight the importance of understanding generative AI’s nuanced impact on the labor market and designing targeted policies to mitigate job displacement while supporting skills development for human-AI collaboration",

        "abstract": "Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.",

        "abstract": "How many workers displaced by automation can realistically transition to safer jobs? We answer this using a validated knowledge graph of 9,978 Egyptian job postings, 19,766 skill activities, and 84,346 job-skill relationships (0.74% error rate). While 20.9% of jobs face high automation risk, we find that only 24.4% of at-risk workers have viable transition pathways--defined by $\\geq$3 shared skills and $\\geq$50% skill transfer. The remaining 75.6% face a structural mobility barrier requiring comprehensive reskilling, not incremental upskilling. Among 4,534 feasible transitions, process-oriented skills emerge as the highest-leverage intervention, appearing in 15.6% of pathways. These findings challenge optimistic narratives of seamless workforce adaptation and demonstrate that emerging economies require active pathway creation, not passive skill matching.",

This study emphasizes how AI plays a critical role in shifting the demands of work away from regular tasks and toward more creative ones, which in turn helps to create high-quality jobs and spur economic growth. Additionally, AI makes virtual agglomeration possible by digitally integrating businesses and increasing job opportunities across many industries and geographical areas. These results highlight the significance of strategic policy frameworks that promote sustained socio-economic development throughout India by proactively tackling possible job displacement and capitalizing on AI’s beneficial effects.",

Studies have increasingly focused on understanding the mechanisms by which certain jobs may be at higher risk of displacement by AI. These studies categorize tasks and skills to assess which jobs are more likely to be complemented or substituted by AI. We investigate how people’s beliefs and expectations about AI compare with theoretical predictions regarding the future impact of automation on their respective jobs, focusing on attitudes toward AI technologies. Our analysis uses data from surveys collected before and after the rise of generative AI (in 2018 and 2024). Specifically, we examine whether people are generally hopeful or fearful of these technologies, and whether they believe AI will exacerbate unemployment or create new job opportunities. We assess how workers’ beliefs about AI are associated with two categories of factors: personal characteristics and job characteristics. Finally, we examine how these influencing factors changed after the introduction of generative AI",

        "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.",

        "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) agents are deployed across economic domains, understanding their strategic behavior and market-level impact becomes critical. This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on skill requirements using 14 million online job vacancies from Chinese listed firms (2018-2022). Employing a novel Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) algorithm trained via contrastive learning and LLM-driven data augmentation, we map vacancy requirements to the ESCO framework. By benchmarking occupation-skill relationships against 2018 O*NET-ESCO mappings, we document a robust causal relationship between AI adoption and the expansion of skill portfolios. Our analysis identifies two distinct mechanisms. First, AI reduces information asymmetry in the labor market, enabling firms to specify current occupation-specific requirements with greater precision. Second, AI empowers firms to anticipate evolving labor market dynamics. We find that AI adoption significantly increases the demand for \"forward-looking\" skills--those absent from 2018 standards but subsequently codified in 2022 updates. This suggests that AI allows firms to lead, rather than follow, the formal evolution of occupational standards. Our findings highlight AI's dual role as both a stabilizer of current recruitment information and a catalyst for proactive adaptation to future skill shifts.",

        "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into China's economy presents a classic governance challenge: how to harness its growth potential while managing its disruptive effects on traditional capital and labor markets. This study addresses this policy dilemma by modeling the dynamic interactions between AI capital, physical capital, and labor within a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey framework. Using annual Chinese data (2016-2023), we quantify the interaction strengths, identify stable equilibria, and perform a global sensitivity analysis. Our results reveal a consistent pattern where AI capital acts as the 'prey', stimulating both physical capital accumulation and labor compensation (wage bill), while facing only weak constraining feedback. The equilibrium points are stable nodes, indicating a policy-mediated convergence path rather than volatile cycles. Critically, the sensitivity analysis shows that the labor market equilibrium is overwhelmingly driven by AI-related parameters, whereas the physical capital equilibrium is also influenced by its own saturation dynamics. These findings provide a systemic, quantitative basis for policymakers: (1) to calibrate AI promotion policies by recognizing the asymmetric leverage points in capital vs. labor markets; (2) to anticipate and mitigate structural rigidities that may arise from current regulatory settings; and (3) to prioritize interventions that foster complementary growth between AI and traditional economic structures while ensuring broad-base distribution of technological gains.",

        "title": "Integrating Generative AI into Cybersecurity Education: A Study of OCR and Multimodal LLM-assisted Instruction",
        "abstract": "This full paper describes an LLM-assisted instruction integrated with a virtual cybersecurity lab platform. The digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially among older workers. With rising emphasis on robotics, automation, AI, and security, re-skilling and up-skilling are essential. Generative AI can help build this workforce by acting as an instructional assistant to support skill acquisition during experiential learning. We present a generative AI instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential learning platform. The assistant employs a zero-shot OCR-LLM pipeline within the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform (2015). Text is extracted from slide images using Tesseract OCR, then simplified instructions are generated via a general-purpose LLM, enabling real-time instructional support with minimal infrastructure. The system was evaluated in a live university course where student feedback (n=42) averaged 7.83/10, indicating strong perceived usefulness. A comparative study with multimodal LLMs that directly interpret slide images showed higher performance on visually dense slides, but the OCR-LLM pipeline provided comparable pedagogical value on text-centric slides with much lower computational overhead and cost. This work demonstrates that a lightweight, easily integrable pipeline can effectively extend legacy platforms with modern generative AI, offering scalable enhancements for student comprehension in technical education.",

        "title": "From Transformers to Large Language Models: A systematic review of AI applications in the energy sector towards Agentic Digital Twins",
        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration. Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend: Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for digital literacy and artificial intelligence (AI) fluency in the workforce has highlighted the need for scalable, efficient programming instruction. This study evaluates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI, specifically OpenAIs ChatGPT, into a self-paced Python programming module embedded within a sixteen-week professional training course on applied generative AI. A total of 86 adult learners with varying levels of programming experience completed asynchronous Python instruction in Weeks three and four, using ChatGPT to generate, interpret, and debug code. Python proficiency and general coding knowledge was assessed across 30 different assessments during the first 13 weeks of the course through timed, code-based evaluations. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed that learners without prior programming experience scored significantly lower than their peers on early assessments. However, following the completion of the accelerated Python instruction module, these group differences were no longer statistically significant,, indicating that the intervention effectively closed initial performance gaps and supported proficiency gains across all learner groups. These findings suggest that generative AI can support accelerated learning outcomes and reduce entry barriers for learners with no prior coding background. While ChatGPT effectively facilitated foundational skill acquisition, the study also highlights the importance of balancing AI assistance with opportunities for independent problem-solving. The results support the potential of AI-augmented instruction as a scalable model for reskilling in the digital economy.",

        "abstract": "The growing emphasis on 21st-century competencies in postsecondary education, intensified by the transformative impact of generative AI, underscores the need to evaluate how these competencies are embedded in curricula and how effectively academic programs align with evolving workforce and societal demands. Curricular Analytics, particularly recent generative AI-powered approaches, offer a promising data-driven pathway. However, analyzing 21st-century competencies requires pedagogical reasoning beyond surface-level information retrieval, and the capabilities of large language models in this context remain underexplored. In this study, we extend prior curricular analytics research by examining a broader range of curriculum documents, competency frameworks, and models. Using 7,600 manually annotated curriculum-competency alignment scores, we assess the informativeness of different curriculum sources, benchmark general-purpose LLMs for curriculum-to-competency mapping, and analyze error patterns. We further introduce a reasoning-based prompting strategy, Curricular CoT, to strengthen LLMs' pedagogical reasoning. Our results show that detailed instructional activity descriptions are the most informative type of curriculum document for competency analytics. Open-weight LLMs achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary models on coarse-grained tasks, demonstrating their scalability and cost-effectiveness for institutional use. However, no model reaches human-level precision in fine-grained pedagogical reasoning. Our proposed Curricular CoT yields modest improvements by reducing bias in instructional keyword inference and improving the detection of nuanced pedagogical evidence in long text. Together, these findings highlight the untapped potential of institutional curriculum documents and provide an empirical foundation for advancing AI-driven curricular analytics.",

        "title": "The AI Pyramid A Conceptual Framework for Workforce Capability in the Age of AI",
        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a qualitative shift in technological change by extending cognitive labor itself rather than merely automating routine tasks. Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale.",

        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is diffusing rapidly, yet its adoption is strikingly unequal. Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.",

        "abstract": "Through extensive experience training professionals and individual users in AI tool adoption since the GPT-3 era, I have observed a consistent pattern: the same AI tool produces dramatically different results depending on who uses it. While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.",

        "abstract": "This research examines how information access affects competition in offline markets. I study the relationship between broadband internet availability and brick-and-mortar retailer survival in the United States from 1999 through 2008, leveraging a period when competition from e-commerce channels was minimal and broadband’s primary effect on retailers stemmed from reduced search costs. Using an instrumental variables estimation strategy that links broadband availability to local slope terrain, I find that broadband availability decreased the likelihood of retailer exit. These effects were more pronounced for retailers that faced higher discovery-related search costs ex ante, specifically young and independent establishments and those in dense or urban markets. The findings suggest that online information access can reshape offline competitive dynamics by altering consumer search and discovery.

Here, we show the development and capabilities of Coscientist, an artificial intelligence system driven by GPT-4 that autonomously designs, plans and performs complex experiments by incorporating large language models empowered by tools such as internet and documentation search, code execution and experimental automation. Coscientist showcases its potential for accelerating research across six diverse tasks, including the successful reaction optimization of palladium-catalysed cross-couplings, while exhibiting advanced capabilities for (semi-)autonomous experimental design and execution. Our findings demonstrate the versatility, efficacy and explainability of artificial intelligence systems like Coscientist in advancing research.",

        "abstract": "This is the Second Key Update to the 2025 International AI Safety Report. The First Key Update (1) discussed developments in the capabilities of general-purpose AI models and systems and associated risks. This Key Update covers how various actors, including researchers, companies, and governments, are approaching risk management and technical mitigations for AI. The past year has seen important developments in AI risk management, including better techniques for training safer models and monitoring their outputs. While this represents tangible progress, significant gaps remain. It is often uncertain how effective current measures are at preventing harms, and effectiveness varies across time and applications. There are many opportunities to further strengthen existing safeguard techniques and to develop new ones. This Key Update provides a concise overview of critical developments in risk management practices and technical risk mitigation since the publication of the 2025 AI Safety Report in January. It highlights where progress is being made and where gaps remain. Above all, it aims to support policymakers, researchers, and the public in navigating a rapidly changing environment, helping them to make informed and timely decisions about the governance of general-purpose AI.

The results from content analysis suggest that Quora is\nlikely to be asked questions from users looking to make money and answers are\nlikely to include personal experiences and examples. ChatGPT simulated versions\nare less personal and more concept-based, including considerations on\nemployment implications and labour rights. It appears therefore that generative\nAI simulates only part of what a human would want in their answers relating to\nthe gig economy. The paper proposes that a similar comparative methodology\nwould also be useful across other research fields to help in establishing the\nbest real world uses of generative AI",
